                                      'Affirmative' means that at least one policy
                                      must evaluate to a positive decision in order
                                      for the final decision to be also positive.
                                      'Unanimous' means that all policies must evaluate
                                      to a positive decision in order for the final
                                      decision to be also positive. 'Consensus' means
                                      that the number of positive decisions must be
                                      greater than the number of negative decisions.
                                      If the number of positive and negative is the
                                      same, the final decision will be negative.
